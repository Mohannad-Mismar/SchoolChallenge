# University Schools Challenge — Unity Game Build

This project was created for a **university-wide school challenge event**, where each school selected their top 3 students to form a team and compete in a live quiz game across **three interactive stages**. The event was successfully held at the university, and this Unity build was used by the event moderator to control the competition.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The competition consists of **three rounds**:

### 📌 Round 1: Bell Questions  
A fast-paced buzzer round where the first player to press the bell button gets the chance to answer the question.

### 📌 Round 2: Spin the Wheel  
A spinning wheel selects one of **five random categories**. Each category contains a set of multiple-choice questions, each with a countdown timer.

### 📌 Round 3: Strikes Round  
A question with multiple correct answers. Players take turns answering one at a time:
- If a player answers incorrectly, they receive a strike.
- Three strikes from one team awards a point to the opposing team.
